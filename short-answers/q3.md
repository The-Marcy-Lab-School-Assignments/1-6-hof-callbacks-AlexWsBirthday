# Question

What is wrong with this code?

```js
const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
const nums = [1, 2, 3];
nums.forEach(printDouble());
```

# Answer

This code doesn't work with the .forEach() syntax structure. It doesn't define each element, or task the .foreach method with what to do with said elements (it doesn't apply the cbf properly). Like so:

```
const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
const nums = [1,2,3];
//
nums.forEach((int) => printDouble(int));
//
```
