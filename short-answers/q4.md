# Question

What is an "inline function"? Give an example with your definition.

# Answer

These are functions which are created within the scope of a function. An example would be the specific requests you make inside a .forEach() method, or adjusting the comparison function within the .sort() method, working within a function.

Almost! We can be extra explicit with our explaination:
An inline function is one that is defined, but not initialized or declared, directly in the code where it is needed. It is also called an anonymous function because it is not given a name when defined.

We use them often for callback functions or when we want to immediately execute something. An example would be using an inline function within a method and logging it to the console:

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers.forEach((num) => console.log(num)); //1, 2, 3
```
